Objective:

1) Create an API for the speed and direction control

INPUTS:

1) int Direction(-180:180): specifies the angle that rover needs to turn relative to current direction vector, where -180:0 is turning left and 0:180 is turning right.

2) int Distance: specifies the range that needs to be travelled along the current direction vector.

3) int Speed: specifies the speed that rover needs to have while travelling.
