From Igor:

I needed to test my T2C algorithm therefore I have modified your Arduino and ESP32 API to enable transmission and reception of targetX/targetY commands.
I have left your original code intact and posted the new versions of the code in the folders above.
The testing I've done so far shows that the introduced changes work correctly with your original code.
