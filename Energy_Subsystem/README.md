# Energy HQ

I have currently separated the development of Batteries and PV Panels into 2 different folders. Check out the relevant research in the different folders.

## Materials

- Solar panels
- SMPS
- Arduino
- AA LiFePO4

## Main Tasks

The energy subsystem will provide the rover with charged batteries using solar panels. The main tasks in this subsystem are:

1. Charge batteries.
2. Battery charge profile design.
3. Battery charge status estimation. Time till completion?
4. Battery balancing algorithm.
5. PV MMPT algorithm.
6. System Integration and Test.
7. Rover range estimation.
8. Prevent explosion/melt.

## Main circuits to build/ deal with

1. USB - Battery
2. Battery - Resistor (Current Aim)
3. PV - Battery (Ultimate aim)
4. PV - resistor (Current Aim)
